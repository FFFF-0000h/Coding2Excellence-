 	A natural number x with exactly 3 digits is read. Generate the largest number that has the same digits as x

	How I think I should solve this problem is this:
	- Read the 3 digit number and break it down into hundredths, tenths and units form
	- Then find the largest of the three numbers and store it
	- Then find the largest of the last two numbers and store it, and store the last digit
	- Then rebuild the stored digits from largest to lowest
