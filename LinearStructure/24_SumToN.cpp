 	Determine the value of the sum S = 1+2+3+ ... + n, for >n< a natural number read from the keyboard
	
	A natural number is any positive whole number you can count with, starting from 1. Usually non-zero, non-negative, non-decimal.
	So natural numbers are:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, â€¦

	Using the formula known as the Gauss Summation Formula or Arithmetic Series Formula (for the special case where the first term is 1 and the common difference is 1).
		S=(n(n + 1)) / 2
