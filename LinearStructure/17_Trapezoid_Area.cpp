 	Determine the area of a trapezoid, given the lengths of the bases b1 and b2, as well as the height h. All three values will be read from the keyboard

	Formula for the Area of a Trapezoid:
The area A of a trapezoid can be calculated using the formula:
A=((b1+b2)â‹…h) / 2 ; Add the two bases, Multiply the sum by the height, Divide the result by 2

Where:

    b1 and b2 are the lengths of the two bases of the trapezoid.

    h is the height of the trapezoid (the perpendicular distance between the two bases).
